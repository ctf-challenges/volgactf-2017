An encrypting and decrypting oracle was found at oracle.quals.2017.volgactf.ru:8789. We managed to get it's script. No flag can be seen...

UPD

We searched thoroughly for several hours and found some ciphertext:

b'\xab\xb9\xe8\x22\x05\xad\xef\xa2\xfa\xdf\x37\xe5\x90\xfe\x2f\x2b\x5b\x9f\xef\x4d\xb9\x11\x88\xfb\x58\x18\xf5\xa6\x63\xa7\x10\xf3'

Will it help?
